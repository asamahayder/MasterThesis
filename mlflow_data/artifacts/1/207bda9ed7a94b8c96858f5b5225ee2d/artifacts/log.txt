Data Shape
Number of samples: 88
Number of scans per sample: 10
Number of time points per scan: 24900
observations so far: 
1) Data is randomly time shifted which shows the time instability of the topticaSmart system
2) The time shift tends to group based on which day the data was sampled
3) The time shift is not only across different samples, but also across multiple pulses on same samples, although to a lesser degree
Shape of data after tukey applied: (16000, 3000)
Shape of data after polynomial fit: (16000, 16)
